# Modeling the Spread of a Virus
This repository contains a project for the Computer Applications Course (ME303) course at Bogazici University, Mechanical Engineering Department. The purpose of this project is to model the spread of a virus, similar to COVID-19, to understand the effects of different parameters on the outcome of the pandemic using the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method.
